# Data Storage by Google

## About this Course

In this [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845), you will learn about the importance of data persistence when building an Android app. We'll introduce you to the fundamentals of SQL, the programming language needed to interact with an SQLite relational database. SQLite is a commonly used method to store large sets of data locally on an Android device.

You'll also learn how to work with Content Providers, which help your data storage to be bug free and to be shared, if you choose, with other apps.
