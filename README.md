Learn Java and Start Building Apps.

This is repository where I will be posting the apps that I built during my [Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) study.

Android apps are everywhere, and learning to build them can be a fantastic career move. No programming experience? No problem! The skills you learn in this beginning Nanodegree program will accelerate your journey to becoming a working Android Developer.

Learn the Java language, and start building amazing new apps for those billion (and counting!) Android devices!
